The managed CR e.g. ManagedKafkaCR represents the managed service concept.
It is the customâ€™s resource contract exchanged between the fleet manager and operated by the fleet shard.
The managed CR spec is only to be modified by the fleet manager.
The managed CR status is only to be updated by the fleet shard as per the single responsibility principle.

The Managed CR is not the user contract (API), it is the implementation of it.
A custom resource based API would have less concepts exposed.
One of the reasons is that a given service tier or might evolve and a user could be moved to a new tier.
Another reason is concrete limits like BW can evolve by tier but are sent to the fleet shard as concrete limit today to execute on.

This model uses the reconciliation loop well popularized by Kubernetes.

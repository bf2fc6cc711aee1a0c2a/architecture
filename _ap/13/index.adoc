When a component depends on a DNS record that it doesn't create itself, it
should verify the existence of that record in the authoritative nameserver,
before attempting to use it through the normal resolution path.
The intention of this pattern is to avoid delays caused by negative DNS caching
of the record in any resolvers on the normal resolution path, especially at
service creation time.

Checking the existence of the DNS record could be done as a wait loop in the
start up routine of the component.
Alternatively the wait can be added as a pre-condition before starting the
component, such as by using an init container on a Pod in Kubernetes.
The latter approach might be used, for example, where the upstream project has
not released a version of the component with the ability, and it's undesirable
to maintain a custom patch/fork of the component.

// Top style tips:
// * Use one sentence per line
// * No unexpanded acronyms
// * No undefined jargon

// You don't have to use the following sections, but they provide a 
// useful structure for writing a clear document.

## Intent
// Summarize in a single sentence what the pattern tries to achieve.
// For example:
//
// Define a policy for exposing metrics to customers in a consistent way.

## Motivation

// In a few paragraphs describe the motivating factors for this pattern
// For example:
// 
// Prometheus scrape endpoints are the defacto standard for exposing metric information for collection
// However this format and the associated conventions are not sufficient in themselves to ensure
// that metrics are exposed in a consistent way. Problems include:
// * Insufficient guidance on metric and label naming to provide consistency and 
//   establishing the principal of hiding implementation details.
// * Treatment of this as a first-class API, with established mechanisms for API evolution
// * etc.

## Applicability

// Call out when this pattern might apply (and when it should not apply, if relevant)
// For example:
//
// This pattern applies to any service which exposes metrics as Prometheus-scrape endpoints.
// It does not apply to services which provide access to metrics in other formats, or via
// means other than an API (e.g. metric visualization via a system such as Grafana).

## Structure

// Describe the pattern.
//
// For this metrics example we might link to existing guidlines on naming, augment them with extra rules 
// which apply to services, explain how the API would allow for graceful API evolution without "flag days".

## Participants

// What components and/or teams are directly involved
//
// For this metrics example this would include the customer and the control plane via which
// the metrics are exposed

## Consequences

// Explain any consequences of using this pattern
//
// For this metrics example consequences would include:
// * A mechanism for API evolution
// * Consistency in naming of metrics and labels within this service
// * Consistency with other services which also apply this AP

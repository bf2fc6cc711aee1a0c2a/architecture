## Intent

Track the decision to use Addons Monitoring as the default Observability Solution for addons.

## Motivation

Being required to have an observability stack is a common consideration for addons so recommending a common approach makes sense.

## Applicability

This applies to any addon as there is a need to provide observability in order to be fully supported as a Managed Service.

## Description

Usage of Addons Monitoring is described in the https://docs.google.com/document/d/15dxGKVUygUJ7NSmil8uf_yOidI9__lGEi_q6FJIE2ic/edit#[ADR document].

## Participants

The component which is used is the https://github.com/rhobs/observability-operator[rhobs/observability-operator]
The team managing the component can be found in slack channel #forum-monitoring

## Trade-offs

Maintaining an observability stack that is life-cycled by the addon itself is a pattern that does exist currently via the
https://github.com/redhat-developer/observability-operator[redhat-developer/observability-operator].
By maintaining a separate stack, changes needed can be made available more quickly as it's tied to the addon version
rather than the OSD version. This comes with its own challenges such as increase workload to manage the release
if a new version of the observability-operator.

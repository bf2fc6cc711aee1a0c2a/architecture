The fleet shard operator has a single version deployed on a given infrastructure cluster.
This is an accepted risk from a blast radius point of view.

Several versions of the instance operator exist on a given infrastructure cluster.
See <<Instance operator responsibility hand over>>.

The Managed CR contains explicitly the targeted version of instance operator. This version is piloted by the fleet manager as part of its blast radius management responsibility.

TODO discuss default version for new instances deployed?

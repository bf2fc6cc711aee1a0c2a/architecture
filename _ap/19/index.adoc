## Intent

Define an architectural approach to better decouple backend services and frontend needs offering a more cohesive UX across devices and tools (such as UI and CLI).
Align all application services under the same implementation of that pattern (see description).

## Motivation

UI and CLI needs to poll information from multiple separate sources causing:

* poor UX, there is need for multiple network calls to offer simple functionalities
* code duplication, data aggregation logic is scattered and duplicated across different users
* testing and mocking, decoupling frontend and backend systems with only one component

## Applicability

This pattern applies when the functionality offered by frontend/CLI/etc. needs to access various APIs and do data aggregation logic in various forms.
In those cases placing a frontend opinionated component in front can be an appropriate solution to speed up development and be a single source of truth for integration logic.

A single BFF component is planned to host the API interactions of our various application services (Kafka, Connectors, Service registry etc).
This is a simplification choice that could be revisited if it becomes burdensome.
Until it is, alignment is expected.

## Description

Implementing a https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/[BFF] for the backend services to better decouple and centralize the integration logic.

Following are key contextual information to understand the pattern and its potential limitations.

Access to the underlying services will be done by propagating the original (user) access token to simplify development and to keep the security model similar to the current architecture.
See ADR 91 for more details.

The implementation choice went for a custom REST endpoint implementation as opposed to using GraphQL.
GraphQL is a popular technology built to address this or a similar set of use cases.
The team's experience lead tot he choice of a custom REST endpoint but could be revisited by this or another team.

The API exposed will not be considered a stable contract usable by customers.
Only its usage through sanctioned clients (UI, CLI, SDK) are going to be supported.
This can be revisited with experience.

This proposal has not explored in detail the impact of private data plane clusters and could be impacted by that architectural evolution.

## Participants

For this pattern to apply you should have more than one "frontend" application:

* UI
* CLI
* SDKs
* mobile apps

and multiple backend services offering together a piece of functionality.

## Trade-offs

A single component in front of the backend, exclusively designed for frontend usage has a number of advantages:

* better decoupling
* looser frontend/backend dependency
* a single point for shared/integration logic
* caching

At the cost of:

* an additional backend component
* risk of APIs proliferation

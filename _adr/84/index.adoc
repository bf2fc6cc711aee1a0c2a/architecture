== Context and Problem Statement
We want to build an upstream community around managed services. This means all aspects of the managed service including the ability to run and manage the service, which extends to operational knowledge & procedures. One such element is Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). These SOPs include information like how to scale up the service as load increases as well as how to diagnose and fix specific issues based on alerting. However, currently these SOPs have been written from an internal perspective and are not immediately usable or consumable upstream.
This document proposes a solution for maintaining an upstream version of the SOPs and having  a mechanism for consuming them downstream, as well as vice versa.

== Goals
* Propose a model for maintaining 2 versions of SOPs, for upstream and downstream consumption.
* Provide a worked example of this model as a reference.

== Non-goals
* Implement a complete solution for a product or service

== Stakeholders
* Eng
* SRE

== Current Architecture
An example of what a current SOP architecture looks like is the Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka (RHOSAK) managed service. The RHOSAK SOPs are located in a private repository, as the SOPs contain references to Red Hat specific internal information that is not suitable for consumption by external users. Such information includes links to secrets, information about how RHOSAK specifically set up their stage and production environments, further communication information e.g contact customer and information on the infrastructure itself. The flow of how information is contributed to the RHOSAK SOPs is for an engineer or SRE to submit PRs to the repo.

== Proposal
The proposed solution is to follow a two repository model. One private repository that will contain SOPs that have the Red Hat internal information mentioned above, the other being a public repository that will have SOPs with the Red Hat internal information removed. This model will allow the SRE teams to use the private SOP repository without any information loss and allow upstream users to use and contribute to the SOP without breaching any Red Hat data policies.

The content of the SOPs will be mirrored/synced between both repositories apart from the Red Hat internal information. The flow of contributing information to the repositories can be done both ways i.e from downstream to upstream and from upstream to downstream. This information can be contributed manually through the creation of pull requests or it can be done autonomously using the mirroring features in the repository. The team in charge of the SOPs will be responsible for maintaining the information between both repositories. This includes merging contributions from external users in the upstream repository and ensuring, if applicable, it gets added to the downstream repository and vice versa.

SOPs from a private downstream repository that contain sensitive information, will have to be cleaned of all sensitive information before being pushed to the upstream public repository. Such information might be links to secrets or information about the managed service infrastructure etc. The pre-existing Structure of the SOPs should also be looked at, to see if any information can be removed that is no longer necessary or can be moved to a different internal location, this will help reduce overhead when syncing.

=== Example implementation
An example implementation of this model can be seen by the RHOSAK team through a ‘steel thread’ they are currently working on. They have implemented an internal downstream version of the SOPs repo in Gitlab, as it comes with asciidoc functionality that github does not provide. Such functionality is asciidoc includes, RHOSAK are using the includes functionality to extrapolate sensitive or repetitive information from the SOPs themselves and have the information in a separate config file that can be used across the SOPs. They will then be able to make the actual SOP asciidoc file available upstream but the sensitive information will not be included as the include config file will not be available upstream. Please see below for example code. The upstream SOPs repo will be located in Github and be public to external users. It will not contain any include config file so no sensitive information will be rendered. The include path will be present so external users can add their own include config file with their own information if they choose to do so.

== Threat model
* Does open-sourcing our SOPs give an attacker information that could be helpful to them in compromising our service?

== Alternatives Considered / Rejected
* Not having a open sourced SOPs repo:
** Keeping the current most common architecture i.e Having a single private SOPs repo only. Rejected as managed services can not open source the SOPs
* Github actions:
** Using github actions and a renderer plugin to remove Red Hat internal information. This allows the ability to have SOPs without sensitive information. Rejected as there was a lot of extra work and overhead needed to get this option working.

== Challenges
Most existing managed services that have pre existing SOPs in a private repo that want to adopt this model, will have to migrate their current SOPs to the upstream public repository. These SOPs may have content already that would need to be stripped back or cleaned for the upstream repo.

The overhead of having to maintain two separate repos, ensuring that neither become out of sync or become unusable and out of date.

== Consequences if not completed
No open source solution for SOPs in various service communities

// What is the background against which this decision is being taken?

Excluding storage sizing, the Kafka service currently supports a single size of Kafka cluster composed of 3 broker pods with fixed CPU, memory and density. 
In order for the service to be more broadly applicable to production Kafka use cases we need to be able to provide it at a variety of scales.
This means that when a user creates a Kafka instance they get to specify "how big" the instance they're creating should be.

## Context and Problem Statement

In order to offer a _scalable_ managed Kafka service we need to support Kafka clusters composed of more than 3 brokers.
This is often known as _horizontal scaling_, and Kafka already supports clusters with large numbers of brokers. 

An immediate consequence of this will be that we will have clusters of different sizes.
We have the choice:

Homogeneous OSD model:: Each OSD cluster houses only Kafka instances with the same number of brokers
Heterogeneous OSD model:: We place Kafka instances of different sizes in the same OSD cluster

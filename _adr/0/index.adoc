 // The most important goal of an ADR is to let you, your team, new team member or third parties to understand a decision and the context in which it was taken.
 // It's a https://xkcd.com/1421/[note to yourself] when you will blame the person that made such "terrible" decision.
 // A second useful aspect is to be the vehicle for discussion on the actual decision while it is being made ; and for non team members to engage into the decisions if they wish to.
 // 
 // So assume you reader is not an expert in the problem. Keep it succinct to help readability, feedback received while writing it will tend to make it bigger so start small.
 // Limit the scope of an ADR to be focused but self contained:
 // - I can read and understand the decision and its context
 // - it is not a bucket list of decisions in a given area
 //
 // The context is particularly important do make sure to answer the following:
 // - why is this decision necessary
 // - what made it tip towards this decision given the context
 // 
 // Top style tips:
 // * Use one sentence per line
 // * No unexpanded acronyms
 // * No undefined jargon - use references to the glossary as appropiate e.g. {glossary-sre}
 // 
 // No need for a title heading, it's added by the template

== Running Locally

[TIP]
====
The `jekyll-github-metadata` plugin will perform some API requests to GitHub, which can lead to rate-limiting warnings.
To avoid seeing these, create a GitHub personal access token with `public_repo` scope, and set it as the value of the `JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
====

Building and running locally requires Ruby and bundler.
You can either bring your own, or use the Jekyll container image.

=== Bring your own Ruby & bundler

----
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental
----

=== Using a container image with Podman or Docker

----
docker run -ti --rm \
    -v .:/srv/jekyll \
    -p 4000:4000 \
    -e JEKYLL_ROOTLESS=1 \
    -e JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN \
    docker.io/jekyll/jekyll \
    jekyll serve --incremental

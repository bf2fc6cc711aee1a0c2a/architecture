// A second useful aspect is to be the vehicle for discussion on the actual decision while it is being made ; and for non team members to engage into the decisions if they wish to.
//
// So assume you reader is not an expert in the problem. Keep it succinct to help readability, feedback received while writing it will tend to make it bigger so start small.
// Limit the scope of an ADR to be focused but self contained:
// - I can read and understand the decision and its context
// - it is not a bucket list of decisions in a given area
//
// The context is particularly important do make sure to answer the following:
// - why is this decision necessary
// - what made it tip towards this decision given the context
//
// Top style tips:
// * Use one sentence per line
// * No unexpanded acronyms
// * No undefined jargon - use references to the glossary as appropiate e.g. {glossary-sre}

== Document types

This pages describes the different kinds of content on this site.

=== Architecture Overview

==== Audience

* External stakeholders
* People new to the project
* Anyone looking for a refresher on the general architecture

==== Description

A living document that serves as an introduction and jumping off point
for the managed service architecture. High level overview of the key
contexts and components. Should link off to more detailed context
overviews and also any key overarching ADRs. Should be kept high level
to minimize the maintenance cost.

==== Process

Updating the Architectural overview is a step part of an ADR or an Epic
Brief elaboration.

=== Context Overview

==== Audience

* External Stakeholders
* New people joining the team particularly if working in a particular
context
* Team members working in other contexts that want a better and deeper
understanding of a particular context
* Anyone looking for a refresher on a particular context

==== Description

Living document that is a focused and detailed architectural overview of
a particular context. Example contexts would include the Control Plane
and Data Plane. Should outline each of the components in that context
(including important if not all sub components. Key interactions should
also be outlined with a reasonable amount of detail while avoiding
implementation details where possible. Should be kept high level to
minimize the maintenance cost.

==== Process

Updating the Context overview is a step part of an ADR or an Epic Brief
elaboration.

=== Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

==== Audience

* Architects / Team Leads / Engineering from all services

==== Description

Captures single important architectural decisions including the why and
what but should avoid implementation details where possible that may
soon become out of date or not apply to other services that want to
follow the decision made in the ADR. ADRs should be addressing how to
solve a problem, their title reflecting it. Other service teams would
reuse these cookbooks.

==== Process

It is expected that ADRs will be matured within an Epic Brief: 
while working on the technical aspect of an Epic Brief, the ADRs will be identified and moved to an appendix while maturing the solution. 
ADRs can then be extracted as a separate document. 
The link:adr-process[ADR process] describes in more detail how ADRs we written and approved.

=== Epic Brief

==== Audience

* Architects / Team Leads / Engineering
* BU and PM

==== Description

Focused design doc that dives into the details of how to execute on a
given solution to the outlined problem. The problem will have often been
